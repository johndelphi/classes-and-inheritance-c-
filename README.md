Design a class named PersonData with the following member variables:

lastName

firstName

address

city

state

zip

phone

Write the appropriate accessor and mutator functions for these member variables.

Next, design a class named CustomerData, which is derived from the PersonData class. The CustomerData class should have the following member variables:

customerNumber

mailingList

The customerNumber variable will be used to hold a unique integer for each customer. The mailingList variable should be a bool.
It will be set to true if the customer wishes to be on a mailing list, or false if the customer does not wish to be on a mailing list. Write appropriate accessor and mutator functions for these member variables. Demonstrate an object of the CustomerData class in a simple program.
